## Introduction

The server is designed to interact with OpenAI's API, providing an interface for chat functionalities and file management. It uses `multer` for handling file uploads, `body-parser` and `cors` for middleware support, and `dotenv` for environment variable management.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/0xHarry2/ChatGPT_integration.git

npm install
```

cd backend:

```
npm install
```


2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```


Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:
` OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`

2. Starting the Server
